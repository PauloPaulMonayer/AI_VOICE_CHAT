- **client/**: Contains the React source code, components, and configuration files.
- **server/**: Contains the Express server code, API routes, controllers, and business logic.

## Front-end

The front-end is built with React and utilizes React Router for navigation. Key pages include:
- **Home:** A landing page featuring a Hero section, About, Advantages, and Testimonials.
- **Chat:** Contains the VoiceChat component for initiating and receiving voice interactions.
- **About/Contact:** Static pages for project information and contact forms.

### Main Features
- Converts speech to text using `react-speech-recognition`
- Sends the captured text to the server for processing
- Plays back the generated audio response to the user

## Back-end

The back-end is built with Node.js and Express. It handles:
- API requests from the front-end (e.g., `/api/generate`)
- Processing text using AI services (e.g., OpenAI)
- Converting text to audio using a Text-to-Speech service
- Returning the audio response as a stream or file to the client

### Workflow
1. Receive a POST request with the user's text.
2. Process the text using an AI service.
3. Convert the processed text to an audio file.
4. Send the audio file back to the client for playback.
